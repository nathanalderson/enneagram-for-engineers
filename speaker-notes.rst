What is the Enneagram?
======================

- question: who's heard of it?
- question: who knows their type?
- A personality type system
- 9 personalities / archetypes / ways of being/seeing
- "ennea" (greek for 9) "gram" (greek for figure)

- it's a tool
- Engineers like tools (debuggers, linters, IDEs, documentation)

You mean like Myers-Briggs?
===========================

- MBTI : Enneagram :: C++ : Haskell
- Both turing complete programming languages, but...
- Completely different paradigm
- Haskell actually has a good type system (burn!)
- If you didn't like MBTI (etc), maybe you'll like Enneagram
- If you *do* like MBTI, Enneagram will expand your mind
- Other systems: DISC, That one with the four animals?, Hogwarts houses?

Background
==========

- Drawn from a number of ancient wisdom traditions
- Mostly oral until 1960s/70s when Oscar Ichazo formalized it
- 80s/90s: Richard Rohr, Don Riso, and others increased its popularity
- Not scientifically or clinically based
- MBTI isn't very reproducible, not scientifically rigorous either
- is it useful? does it ring true?

Takeaways
=========

As we transcend our personality, our ego, our number, then we can allow our depest, truest self to
emerge without the behaviors and mechanisms that we put on throughout life to make our way in the
world. And you you are at your core... is love. And love moves freely and fluidly through and above
and in and out of all of the types: now its a helper, now its assertive, now its a peacemaker.

The first step to this transcendence/enlightnment/personal growth/spiritual growth, is learning to
observer--without judgment--your self, your ego, and its patters and defenses and strengths and
weaknesses so that by observing, we can become no longer a slave to it.

So DO YOUR WORK.

Just like you work on your projects, work equally hard on yourself.

Pick:
- enneagram
- mindfulness
- other spiritual practice
- therapy
- all of the above

But make sure it helps you
- harness your strengths
- improve your weaknesses
- understand yourself and others
- love yourself and others
